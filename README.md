# Car Rental App

## Project Description

This project has been developed to demonstrate the capabilities of creating a
web application for a car rental company. The application's main features
include:

### Load More

On the car catalog page, users can load additional advertisements by clicking
the "Load More" button. By default, 8 advertisements are displayed.

### Adding to Favorites

Users can add advertisements to their favorites, and the color of the button
changes to indicate the "favorite" status. Clicking the button again removes the
advertisement from favorites.

### Preserving User Actions

When the page is refreshed, the final result of the user's actions is preserved,
including the list of favorite advertisements.

### Modal Window

Clicking the "Learn More" button opens a modal window with detailed information
about the car and rental conditions. The modal can be closed by clicking the "X"
button, pressing the Esc key, or clicking on the backdrop.

### Car Mileage

The car's mileage is displayed in the format "4,500" in the UI, but it is
specified as a single value in the code (e.g., 4500).

### Contacting the Company

The "Rental Car" button is implemented as a link, allowing users to contact the
company via the phone number +380730000000.

- React for developing the user interface.
